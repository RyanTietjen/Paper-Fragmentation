# Paper Abstract Fragmentation
Machine learning model that breaks down the abstract of a research paper into 5 categories (objective, background, methods, results, and conclusion).

You can find a demo of my model on my [HuggingFace.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/RyanTietjen/Food_Classification_PyTorch)

This model achieved a testing accuracy of 88.12% and a F1 score of 87.92%.

This project was based off of the papers [PubMed 200k RCT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06071) and [Neural Networks for Joint Sentence Classification in Medical Paper Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251)
